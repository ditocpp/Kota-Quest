Indonesia is known as a country that upholds the value of helping each other. However, not everyone can help other people in need because there is no way to know if someone is in trouble or needs assistance. That's why we provide a solution to create “Kota Quest”. “Kota Quest” is a Smart City application that gamifies mutual assistance services on a per city basis. This application is made to complete requests given by the community and of course also as a form of concern for the community by mutual cooperation.

Kota Quest is deployed using Google Firebase SDK.
