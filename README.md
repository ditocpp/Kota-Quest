Indonesia is known as the nation that upholds the value of communal work and helping each other. Especially in rural areas, these principles are still held tightly. However, in urban areas, we often see how hard it is to ask for help from the big cities citizens, let alone befriending them. Because of this dominant individualistic behaviors from city dwellers as opposed to rural villagers, the ignorant mindset is formed withing the majority of people there. Based on this problem, Kota Quest: Quest Board Application for City Folks is created. The development of this application is an effort to re-apply the Indonesian principles to help each other especially in urban areas
The application implements Kotlin as the programming language and Firebase the back-end, and other tools to develop the application. The result is a mobile Android application which connects directly to Firebase datastore real-time. This Application will hopefully preserve the culture of communal work which has since been hard to find in city dwellers.

Kota Quest is deployed using Google Firebase SDK.
